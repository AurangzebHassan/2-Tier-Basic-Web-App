# 2-Tier-Basic-Web-App v1.0
Basic 2-Tier Web App implemented using Java, HTML, and CSS. It runs using Apache Tomcat webserver.
This project uses an Apache Tomcat server to take a user's first and last name. There is a text file which includes the names allowed. The names entered are validated from the file and a success or failure to login page is shown.

This is the first version I made. Hence, the name 'v1.0'.
